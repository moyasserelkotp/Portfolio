# Portfolio Deployment

This is a simple, static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To deploy it, you need a web server or a static hosting provider.

## Prerequisites

*   A web server (like Apache or Nginx) or a static hosting provider (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel).

## Deployment Steps

1.  **Upload the files:** Upload the `protfolio.html` and `links.txt` files to the root directory of your web server or static hosting provider.

2.  **That's it!** Your portfolio should now be live at your domain.

## External Dependencies

This project relies on the following external services:

*   **Google Fonts:** For the "Inter" and "Poppins" fonts.
*   **Font Awesome:** For the icons.
*   **jQuery:** A JavaScript library used for the testimonial carousel.
*   **Slick Carousel:** A jQuery plugin for the testimonial carousel.

If any of these services are unavailable, it may affect the site's appearance and functionality.
